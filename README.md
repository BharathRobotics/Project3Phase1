# Project3Phase1
This project is an implementation of A* algorithm to find a path between start and end point on a given map for a mobile robot. The project is divided into three main phases.
1) Check the feasibility of all inputs/outputs
2) Implement A* Algorithm to find a path between start and end point on a given map for a mobile robot.
3) code must output an animation of optimal path generation between start and goal point on the map. You need to show both the node exploration as well as the optimal path generated. (Some useful  tools  for  simulation  are  OpenCV/Pygame/Matplotlib).
